## 📖 Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using supervised learning techniques. It uses a dataset containing various attributes of houses and applies regression models to estimate the price. The notebook walks through the entire ML pipeline — from data loading and cleaning to model evaluation.

---

## 🔍 Features
- Loads and explores housing dataset
- Handles missing values and outliers
- Encodes categorical variables
- Applies feature scaling and transformation
- Trains multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Evaluates models using metrics like RMSE and R²
- Visualizes predictions and residuals

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Reads CSV dataset into pandas DataFrame.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans data, handles nulls, encodes categories.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selects and transforms relevant features.
4. **Model Training**: Fits regression models to training data.
5. **Evaluation**: Compares models using RMSE, R², and visual plots.
6. **Prediction**: Predicts prices for new or test data.
